# DeCare-Intro
DeCare is an Android application to support in-home caregiver to improve quality of dementia patient's life.
DeCare can perform early detection of dementia using MMSE Screening. The results of
MMSE Screening and the patient's personal data will be analyzed by a Machine
Learning model from Cloud to predict whether the patient is suffering from
dementia or not. Not only that, DeCare will improve the patientâ€™s quality of life by
its functionality such as daily exercise guidance, a reminder of their scheduled
activities, articles to improve their knowledge, and progress recapitulation.
Therefore, we conclude that these are our features: Login/Register, Panduan
Aplikasi, Deteksi Dini, Jadwal Kegiatan, Olahraga, Artikel, Data Diri, Rekap
Kegiatan, Caregiver Service, and Games.
